# Architecture

## System Overview

Describe the overall structure of the system.

Example:

This project is built as a layered backend architecture using:

- Controller layer (REST endpoints)
- Service layer (business logic)
- Repository layer (database access)

Technologies used:

- Java
- Javalin
- JPA / Hibernate
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- JWT authentication

---

## Architecture Diagram

(Optional but recommended)

You can include a simple diagram showing the main components.

Example:

```

Client → REST Controller → Service → Repository → Database

```

Or include an image if you created a diagram.

---

## Key Design Decisions

Describe important technical decisions you made.

Examples:

- Why you chose your project structure
- How authentication works
- How errors are handled
- Why you chose specific libraries or frameworks

Example:

**Authentication**

Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens.  
Users log in and receive a token which must be included in subsequent API requests.
